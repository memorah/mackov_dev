        <h1>Hi, I’m Filip,</h1>

        <p>
          Hi, I'm Filip, A former mSME bank relationship manager who fell in
          love with website development and coding. I've always been tempted to
          create websites, but I didn't have time because of work. During an
          unexpected sabbatical, I decided to learn to code. I was learning
          every day. I learned HTML, CSS and started working on my skills in JS
          and WP. When I returned to working in a bank, it wasn't easy. I was
          thinking all day about what I would do when I returned to VS Code.
        </p>

        <p>
          Shortly afterward, I got a chance to work as a junior at the digital
          agency Sharkani, where I currently work as Head of Development. I like
          the diversity of projects the most. In my position, I am responsible
          for finding suitable solutions for clients. This allows me to spend a
          part of my working time learning. I also take care of creating the
          Wireframe; I cooperate with designers on the resulting UI&UX, hence, I
          allow my skills to develop in this direction.
        </p>

          In the last quarter of 2021, I was an intern at Power Play Studio,
          working with tools like Docker, Zeplin, and the VUE.js framework. It
          was a great experience to get an insight into a big project. At the
          moment, I am mainly interested in VUE.js.
