        <h1>Hi, I’m Filip,</h1>

        <p>
          a former mSME bank relationship manager who fell in love with website
          development and coding. I've always been tempted to create websites,
          but I didn't have time because of work. During an unexpected
          sabbatical, I decided to learn to code. I was learning every day. I
          learned HTML, CSS and started working on my skills in JS and WP. When
          I got back to the bank, I couldn't be there anymore. I've been
          thinking all day what I'm going to do when I get back to VS Code.
        </p>

        <p>
          Shortly afterwards, I got a chance as a junior at the digital agency
          Sharkani, where I still work as Head of Development. I like the
          diversity of projects the most. In my position, I am responsible for
          finding suitable solutions for clients. This allows me to spend a part
          of my working time with learning. I also take care of creating the
          Wireframe, I cooperate with designers on resulting UI&UX. I develop my
          skill's in this direction as well.

          In the last quarter of 2021, I was an intern at Power Play Studio,
          where I tried tools like Docker, Zeplin and the VUE.js framework. It
          was a great experience to get an insight into a big project. At the
          moment I am mainly interested in VUE.js.
