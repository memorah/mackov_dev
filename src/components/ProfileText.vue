        <h1>Hi, I’m Filip,</h1>

        <p>
          an ex-bank mSME relationship manager who has fallen in love with
          website building and coding. I've always been tempted to create
          websites, but because of my work I didn't have time for that. In
          unexpected sabbatical and I decided learn to how to code. I studied
          studied every day. I learned HTML, CSS and started working on JS and
          WP skill's. When I returned to the bank, I could no longer be there. I
          was thinking allday's about what I will do when I turn on Visual
          Visual Studio Code again.

          Shortly afterwards, I got a chance as a junior at the digital agency
          Sharkani, where I still work as Head of Development. I like the
          diversity of projects the most. In my position, I am responsible for
          finding suitable solutions for clients. This allows me to spend a
          learning. I also take care of creating the and in and in in
          cooperation with the designers the resulting UI&UX, for me to for for
          for me to develop my skill's in this direction as well.

          In the last quarter of 2021, I was an intern at a power play studio,
          where I tried out tools docker, zeplin and VUE.js. It was a great
          great great experience to look inside a big project. In addition to
          currently mainly interested in VUE.js.
